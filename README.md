# Password-Generator

Simple password generator using Python and its TkInter library. A main window will open and you will be able to select between three complexity modes: simple (alphabetic characters), common (alphanumeric characters) and complex (alphanumeric and ASCII characters), and the length of your password, that must be higher than 7.
This is the very early version of this program, coded on Python 2.4
