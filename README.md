Simple password generator using Python and its TkInter library. A main window will open and you will be able to select between three complexity modes: simple (alphabetic characters), common (alphanumeric characters) and complex (alphanumeric and ASCII characters) and the length of your password, that must be higher than 7.
This program is coded on Python 3.5 and has been updated from the very early version of the program, coded on Python 2.4
